To mitigate OpenSSH threats, the following security measures are recommended:

Implement robust password policies: Enforce the use of strong passwords that adhere to complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, character diversity).
Disable direct root login: Prohibit direct login to the root account to hinder brute-force attacks targeting this privileged user.
Modify the default port: Change the default SSH port number to obscure the service from automated port scans and reduce its exposure to common attack vectors.
